Pyramidal Optical Flow Performance Analysis
===========================================

Performance analysis on cuda optical flow using chrono. The reason why nsight was not used is in order to also measure the cudamemcpy overhead.

NOTE: This project is still a work in progress, major refactoring needs to be done on the main optical flow code and a couple of more algorithm optimizations need to be implemented
